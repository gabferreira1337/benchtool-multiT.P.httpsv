# Benchmark Client and Multiprocesses and Multithreading HTTP Server

## 
Developed a simplified HTTP server and test clients, with the aim of

improve application performance and scalability.

I implemented,in a concurrent programming paradigm, the

mechanisms to more effectively use the resources available on the machine. A

system performance metric is related to the total response time of the point of

view from the client (time elapsed between sending the HTTP request and receiving the

response). In this way, the server  is based on an implementation

multi-process  and multitasking, while the client is a benchmarking tool.
